# Milestone 3 Reflection

## Features Implemented:

In response to the feedback and recommendations gathered from our peers and stakeholders, we have implemented several enhancements to our dashboard, focusing on improving clarity, interactivity, and overall user experience.

### Enhancements Implemented:

1. **Map Interaction:** We addressed the issue of limited interactivity by introducing a more intuitive map interaction feature. Users can now select specific countries directly on the map, triggering dynamic updates to the displayed data. Visual cues such as borders, shadows, or color changes highlight the selected country, enhancing user engagement and facilitating data exploration.

2. **Title and Legends Clarity:** To improve clarity and ensure accurate interpretation of the data, we revamped the titles and legends throughout the dashboard. Clear, descriptive titles now accompany each chart, providing context and guiding users in their analysis. Legends have been updated to reflect changes based on user selections, such as currency type or inflation adjustments.

3. **Layout and Organization:** We restructured the layout of the dashboard to enhance organization and streamline user navigation. Charts and controls are now aligned in clear columns, improving readability and usability. The addition of a sidebar or control panel for user selections further enhances the overall user experience, making it easier for users to interact with the dashboard.

4. **Data Representation:** Building on peer inspiration and best practices, we explored the use of median wage instead of average wage for better data representation. This adjustment helps mitigate the impact of outliers and provides users with a more accurate understanding of wage trends.

## Challenges Addressed:

1. **Zoom Functionality:** We addressed the challenge of excessive zooming out in the map functionality, ensuring a more controlled and intuitive user experience. While full zoom and pan functionality are not yet implemented, we have laid the groundwork for future enhancements in this area.

## Prospects for Enhancement:

While the current iteration of the dashboard represents a significant improvement, we remain committed to continuous enhancement and refinement. Future prospects for enhancement include:

1. **Dynamic Narratives and Images:** Incorporating dynamic narratives and images to provide context and insights into the data presented.

2. **Branding Integration:** Introducing McDonald's branding colors and visual elements to align the dashboard more closely with the Big Mac Index concept.

3. **Dynamic Filters and Tooltips:** Implementing dynamic filters and tooltips to enhance user interaction and provide additional information on data points.

4. **Detailed Data Tables:** Exploring the addition of a separate page for detailed data tables, allowing users to delve deeper into minimum wage trends and inflation adjustments.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the updated dashboard represents a significant step forward in terms of usability, clarity, and interactivity. By incorporating user feedback and best practices, we have created a more intuitive and informative tool for exploring economic trends through the Big Mac Index. We remain committed to ongoing improvement and look forward to incorporating further enhancements based on user feedback and evolving needs.
