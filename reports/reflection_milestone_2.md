# Milestone 2 Reflection

## Features Implemented
In our endeavor to craft a dashboard that elucidates purchasing power parity (PPP) and economic trends via the Big Mac Index, we diligently integrated several features from our initial proposal. The heatmap, a pivotal aspect, was successfully incorporated, providing a global visualization of the Big Mac's purchasing power. We prioritized user experience, ensuring our dashboard not only presents data effectively but does so with aesthetic clarity, avoiding unnecessary complexity. We also included a specific dataset reference, grounding our visualizations in tangible, credible sources.

##Limitations Identified

During the development, we noticed that the world map's zoom function could overextend, potentially compromising the user's focus. The absence of a "select/deselect all" button in the dropdown menu emerged as a minor inconvenience. A significant challenge was managing plot titles with excessive country listings, prompting us to consider title length restrictions. Moreover, the map's interactivity was limited to displaying only the average price per night, which restrained the depth of information available at a glance.

## Discrepancies Between Proposal and Implementation

Comparing our initial sketch to the final dashboard revealed adaptations. We optimized spatial utility by condensing the number of plots within the chart box from four to three. This decision was driven by implementation constraints and the intent to maintain an uncluttered interface. 

## Acknowledged Bugs and Developmental Features

As of this reflection, the map's interactivity feature is not operational. We intend to address this as our proficiency with the technology grows throughout the course. Recognizing this as a feature under development will help distinguish it from a malfunction.

## Current Dashboard Strengths and Weaknesses

Our dashboard adeptly leverages visual analytics to communicate complex economic indicators in a user-friendly manner. The widget filters and dynamic plots that adjust to user preferences stand out as robust features. Nevertheless, the current lack of interactivity on the map and a potentially overwhelming number of countries listed in plot titles are areas we are keen to refine.

## Prospects for Enhancement

Looking ahead, we aim to augment the dashboard with additional features. These enhancements include visualizing more dataset attributes, such as the distribution number of Big Macs bought with an hour's wage. We plan to introduce a separate page dedicated to a data table for users interested in specifics. Incorporating detailed data on individual countries' minimum wage trends, adjusting for inflation, and possibly integrating a city-level analysis could offer granular insights. Optimizing our read_json function for faster dashboard performance is also on the horizon.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while the dashboard presently serves as an effective educational and analytical tool, we are committed to evolving its capabilities. The envisioned interactive map will soon provide a more immersive experience, and our continuous learning will undoubtedly translate into progressive dashboard enhancements.
