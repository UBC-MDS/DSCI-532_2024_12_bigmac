# Milestone 2 Reflection

## Features Implemented
In our effort to craft a dashboard that elucidates purchasing power parity (PPP) and economic trends via the Big Mac Index, we diligently integrated several features from our initial proposal. The heatmap, a pivotal aspect, was successfully incorporated, providing a global visualization of the Big Mac's purchasing power. We prioritized user experience, ensuring our dashboard not only presents data effectively but does so with aesthetic clarity, avoiding unnecessary complexity. We also included a specific dataset reference, grounding our visualizations in tangible, credible sources.

## Limitations Identified

We have identified several areas in need of attention. For instance, the world map's zoom function allows for excessive zooming out, which may reduce user engagement. It could also offer greater interactivity, particularly when a user selects a specific country on the map. Moreover, the titles, axes, and lengths of the current plots are somewhat ambiguous, and in some cases, the excessive listing of country names clutters the visual space.

## Discrepancies Between Proposal and Implementation

Comparing our initial sketch to the final dashboard revealed adaptations. We optimized spatial utility by condensing the number of plots within the chart box from four to three. This decision was driven by implementation constraints and the intent to maintain an uncluttered interface. 

## Current Dashboard Strengths and Weaknesses

Our dashboard adeptly leverages visual analytics to communicate complex economic indicators in a user-friendly manner. The widget filters and dynamic plots that adjust to user preferences stand out as robust features. Nevertheless, the current lack of interactivity on the map and a potentially overwhelming number of countries listed in plot titles are areas we are keen to refine.

## Prospects for Enhancement

Looking ahead, we aim to augment the dashboard with more interactive features. 
For example, so far the map's interactivity feature is not operational. We intend to address this as our proficiency with the technology grows throughout the course. Recognizing this as a feature under development will help distinguish it from a malfunction. 

What's more, an immediate area for improvement is the clarification of plot axes and titles. For instance, in the time series plots for Big Mac price and minimum wage, the y-axis will be more intuitive if labeled to reflect what the values represent. Enhancing the clarity of legends is also on our agenda, with labels like "dollar price" and "Adjusted USD wage" to be revised to "Big Mac price in USD" and "Adjusted hourly USD wage," respectively.

Last but not least, we plan to introduce a separate page dedicated to a data table for users interested in specifics. Incorporating detailed data on individual countries' minimum wage trends, adjusting for inflation, and possibly integrating a city-level analysis could offer granular insights. Optimizing our read_json function for faster dashboard performance is also on the horizon.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while the dashboard presently serves as an effective educational and analytical tool, we are committed to evolving its capabilities. The envisioned interactive map will soon provide a more immersive experience, and our continuous learning will undoubtedly translate into progressive dashboard enhancements.
