# Milestone 3 Reflection

## Features Implemented

In our continuous effort to enhance understanding of purchasing power parity (PPP) and economic trends through the Big Mac Index, we integrated key features from our initial proposal, including a critical heatmap for global visualization of the Big Mac's purchasing power. Prioritizing user experience led to a design that balances data presentation with aesthetic clarity and simplicity. We maintained a specific dataset reference to anchor our visualizations in credible sources.

## Limitations Identified 

Since Milestone 1, we have identified several challenges, particularly with the map's zoom functionality, which allows excessive zooming out, potentially reducing engagement. Additionally, the need for more interactive elements became evident, especially in enabling users to select specific countries directly on the map. The clarity of titles, axes, and plot designs also requires improvement due to the current ambiguous presentation and clutter caused by the excessive listing of country names.

## Improvement implemented 

We significantly enhanced the overall design in terms of layout and clarity.

### Specific Adjustment:

**Title and Legends**: Improved the clarity of titles and legends to accurately reflect the data presented (e.g., specifying whether the wage is hourly or annual). Updated legends to reflect changes based on user selections (e.g., currency type).

**Map Interaction**: Highlighted the selected country on the map using visual cues like borders, shadows, or color changes. We are considering implementing zoom and pan functionality for the map in a future iteration.

**Currency and Inflation**:  Moved the currency selection radio button closer to the chart it affects and clarified how inflation adjustment impacts the data.

**Layout and Organization**: Adjusted the layout so that charts and controls are aligned in clear columns for better organization. We are considering adding a sidebar or control panel for user selections in a future iteration. 

**Data Representation**: Explored using median wage instead of average wage for better representation and to avoid outliers. We are considering allowing multi-country selection in future iterations to assess its impact on each chart's functionality.

### Challenging part: Peer Inspiration from group 22

Inspired by the dashboard from team 22, we adjusted the color layout and filter arrangement of our dashboard for better contrast and readability.

## Prospects for Enhancement
With all the improvements, our current dashboard effectively and efficiently uses visual analytics to present complex economic data in an accessible format. Widget filters and dynamic plots are highlights. In the future, we plan to stay open to potential advice from users. We may also introduce dynamic narratives and images, incorporate McDonald's branding colors, and add dynamic filters and tooltip features for better user interaction. A separate page for detailed data tables may provide users with in-depth insights into minimum wage trends and adjustments for inflation.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, while the dashboard currently serves as an effective educational and analytical tool, we are committed to evolving its capabilities. The envisioned interactive map will soon provide a more immersive experience, and our continuous learning will undoubtedly translate into progressive dashboard enhancements.
