# Dashboard Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the contributors and maintainers of the Dashboard project, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of personal backgrounds and identities. We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.

## Our Standards

Positive behaviors that contribute to a welcoming environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Prioritizing what is best for the community
* Demonstrating empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Harassment in public or private
* Publishing others' private information without explicit consent
* Any other conduct deemed inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Dashboard project maintainers are responsible for setting standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate action in response to instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to moderate comments, commits, code, and other contributions that are not in line with this Code of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they find inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the Dashboard project or its community. This includes using an official project email, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Dashboard project team. Contact details will be provided separately. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality for the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the tidyverse Code of Conduct, which itself was adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4. For more details, visit [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).
