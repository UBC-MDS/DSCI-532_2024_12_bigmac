# Code of Conduct for Dashboard

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the dashboard project environment, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our Code of Conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors, maintainers, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We commit to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, safe, and inclusive community.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accept constructive criticism gracefully
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show empathy towards other community members
* Consider community members when making decisions
* Resolve disagreements and conflicts constructively
* Offer help to those unsure and answer questions in a helpful manner

### Unacceptable Behavior

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official project e-mail, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, the idocode Community Code of Conduct, and the Pandas Contributor Code of Conduct, reflecting a blend of industry-standard practices and our unique community expectations.
